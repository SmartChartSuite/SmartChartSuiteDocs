Swagger
=======

RC-API is built with FastAPI which will automatically generate Swagger documentation for defined API endpoints. This can be accessed via the "/docs/" endpoint (e.g. "http://localhost/rc-api/docs"). For the live version (requires GTRI VPN to access) the Swagger docs can be found at https://gt-apps.hdap.gatech.edu/rc-api/docs.
